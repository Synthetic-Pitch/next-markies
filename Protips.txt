HOW TO HANDLE HEAVY WORK LOAD:

structure must be like this for low latency and secure API:
User Requests → Cloudflare (Cache & Rate Limit) → Vercel Edge API → Redis Cache → Database (Prisma)

CONCLUSION:
Rate limit requests (prevent spam) ✅
Use caching (reduce repeated requests) ✅
Distribute traffic using Load Balancers ✅
Process heavy work in the background ✅
Use Edge Functions for lower latency ✅
Optimize DB queries & use connection pooling ✅
